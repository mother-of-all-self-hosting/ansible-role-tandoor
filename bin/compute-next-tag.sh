# Prints the tag that the currently checked out commit should be released as,
# or nothing at all if it does not warrant a release.
#
# Usage: bin/compute-next-tag.sh
#
# Tags look like `v<Tandoor version>-<release>`, which is what this repository
# has always published (v1.5.34-0 ... v2.6.13-1):
#
# - if defaults/main.yml points at a Tandoor version that has never been
#   released, the release counter restarts at 0 (`v2.6.14-0`)
# - otherwise the counter is incremented (`v2.6.13-2`), but only if something
#   that actually affects the role has changed since the last release
#
# Determining the version from defaults/main.yml, rather than from the commit
# message of the pull request that got merged, makes the result independent of
# the order in which pull requests get merged, and lets any change to the role
# (bugfix, feature, dependency bump) release itself without a human tagging.
#
# The commit-message approach this replaced only looked at commits authored by
# `renovate[bot]` whose subject contained "docker tag to" and "tandoor". This
# repository has never had a single commit by that author - every version bump
# so far was made by hand - so that workflow could not have cut any of the tags
# it appears to have cut, and the 2.6.13 bump indeed sat untagged until it was
# tagged by hand.
